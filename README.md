Archived Sub Rosa plugins, .blends, and more.



Plugins
Some are not mine, dont be suprised if some dont work, I dont own Sub Rosa anymore so I cant test it, 99% of the plugins are worthless terribly coded garbage



- Blend instructions
Lot of stuff in the .blends link directly to Sub Rosa assets, I cannot provide them here unfortunately, you'll have to manually route them to sub rosa folders yourself
